# Derecho with Libfabric
[OFI Libfabric](https://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/) is a **remote direct memory access (RDMA)** communication library. It unifies the distinct programming APIs of different RDMA hardware with a thin layer. We are working on Derecho porting to libfabric so that it can support applications in more environments. Specifically, libfabric can work on TCP/IP network without special RDMA hardware, making Derecho available to almost all cloud application.

# Throughput Test
We tested the derecho throughput with 100Gbps InfiniBand and throughputs. (Explanation to be added later.)

# Latency Test
