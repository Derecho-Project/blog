Derecho worked with ibverbs API. We are working on a new version using Libfabric, which adapts Derecho to [more environments](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric): TCP/IP(no RDMA hardware required), Intel Omni-Path, Cray GNI, etc... We currently tested it with TCP/IP, InfiniBand, and RoCE. More details are [here](https://github.com/Derecho-Project/blog/blob/master/docs/libfabric.md).
