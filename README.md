In the next couple of months, we plan to try Derecho in geographically distributed environment.
1) Testing Derecho + libfabric/TCP in wide area network.
2) A storage prototype with Derecho replicating data geographically.

## 28-JUN-2018: A Glance of Derecho with Libfabric.
Derecho worked with ibverbs API. We are working on a new version using Libfabric, which adapts Derecho to [more environments](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric): TCP/IP(no RDMA hardware required), Intel Omni-Path, Cray GNI, etc... We currently tested it with TCP/IP, InfiniBand, and RoCE. More details are [here](https://github.com/Derecho-Project/blog/blob/master/docs/libfabric.md).
